My Mirror on Cloud is a Python package with a Streamlit interface that together form a fashion recommendation engine.

## üéØ Project Overview

My Mirror on Cloud is a Python package with a Streamlit interface that forms an intelligent fashion recommendation system. Using the [H&M dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data) from Kaggle, the system analyzes fashion items through FashionCLIP, a specialized encoder model for fashion image understanding.

User queries are processed through Large Language Models to interpret and format requests intelligently, distinguishing whether a single clothing item is desired or a coordinated outfit for a particular occasion. The encoded image representations are stored in a Weaviate vector database for lightning-fast similarity searches.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Visual Search**: Upload a fashion item photo to find visually similar products
- **Text-to-Fashion**: Describe your desired style in natural language
- **Smart Query Understanding**: LLM-powered interpretation distinguishes between single item requests and complete outfit recommendations
- **FashionCLIP Embeddings**: Specialized computer vision model optimized for fashion similarity
- **Fast Retrieval**: Efficient similarity search powered by Weaviate vector database
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly Streamlit interface requiring no technical knowledge
- **Flexible Architecture**: Modular design tested with multiple models (FashionCLIP, CLIP, Qwen2.5-VL)

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Fashion items from the H&M catalogue are preprocessed and organized
2. **Visual Embedding**: Images are encoded using FashionCLIP to capture visual and fashion-specific features
3. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in Weaviate vector database alongside metadata in SQL for efficient retrieval
4. **Query Understanding**: User requests are processed by LLMs to interpret intent and format queries appropriately
5. **Intent Detection**: The system distinguishes between single item searches and complete outfit recommendations
6. **Similarity Search**: Nearest neighbor search retrieves the most visually similar items from the vector database
7. **Virtual Try-On** (Optional): CatVTON generates realistic visualizations of selected items on user photos
8. **Results Display**: Recommendations are presented through an intuitive Streamlit interface
